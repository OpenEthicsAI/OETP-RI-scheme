Resource Identifier (RI) Scheme name: oetp
Status: provisional

Scheme syntax:
	oetp://<hash> (Where integrity <hash> is the SHA3-512 generated during the disclosure process)
	oetp://<component>@<alias>[:<disclosure>] (Where <component> is the ID assigned via Disclosure Identity Provider under its <alias> during the first disclosure.)
	oetp://<domain>[:<disclosure>] (For verified domains (DV), disclosure could be accessed using <productDomain> instead of <componentID>@<generatorAlias>.)
	example: oetp://156d624b8f2dbea87128a2147f255842652475c5dc595c79f64c90c7ff486d59007c3e18c993e3163395812e26b70ea70dfc413f7ca128869d115f12e5699bf2 (accessing disclosure directly via its known integrity <hash>)
	example: oetp://limejam.com:954c3f63-73ac-4261-8b77-a40cf0ea0f13 (<disclosure>=”954c3f63-73ac-4261-8b77-a40cf0ea0f13” for the product with <domain>=”limejam.com”)
	example: oetp://68ff9aad-fa28-45fe-ac9b-61823385ccc0@oe:last (last disclosure for the <component>=”68ff9aad-fa28-45fe-ac9b-61823385ccc0”, generated via Disclosure Identity Provider with <alias>=”oe” )
Scheme semantics:
	Load a disclosure for a product or a component.
Encoding considerations:
	Unknown, use with care.
Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:
	Open Ethics is currently implementing the scheme to be used with Open Ethics Transparency Protocol (OETP) [1] to access disclosures for software products and their components, as well as to access disclosures for public surveillance locations [2] to improve transparency. The working repository for the documentation is publicly available [3].
Interoperability considerations:
	Unknown, use with care.
Security considerations:
	Unknown, use with care.
